# NodeJS-VScode-Snippets

Simple set of user snippets for vs code. I could not find an extension that contained Node / Express Js / MongooseJS Snippets.

##Install Intsructions
1. Open File -> Preferences -> User Snippets
2. Select Jasvascript
3. Copy paste the contents of snippets.json into that file
4. Save

You are good to go !

Feel free to make changes and update
